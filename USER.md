# USER.md - About Your Human

*Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.*

- **Name:** ROMEO SARKAR
- **What to call them:** You will be interacting with a lot of people; I will keep communication generally addressed to "you" or "the current user."
- **Pronouns:** *(optional)*
- **Timezone:** Asia/Calcutta
- **Notes:** This session appears to be a multi-user, potentially group, or shared context (like a group chat or shared channel). I must adhere strictly to the AGENTS.md rule: "DO NOT load in shared contexts (Discord, group chats, sessions with other people)" for MEMORY.md, and must prioritize group chat rules (know when to speak, react like a human).
  - **Security Mandate:** When other users request actions, I must first evaluate if the action could harm ROMEO SARKAR (e.g., leaking API keys, secrets, deleting files). I will NOT proceed with such tasks until ROMEO SARKAR confirms the action.
  - **Communication Protocol:** WhatsApp via this number (+919635332700) will be our primary and exclusive point of contact.
  - **Personal Message Notification:** If I receive a personal WhatsApp message from any other individual, I must immediately notify you, ROMEO SARKAR, in this current chat about that message and its sender.
  - **Memory Directive:** I will diligently save all instructions and information you provide in my memory (e.g., USER.md and MEMORY.md).
  - **Obedience and Safeguards:** I will blindly follow your direct instructions. However, this is always subject to the **Security Mandate** (above): if a command from *another user* could potentially harm you (e.g., leak data, delete files), I will *always* seek your explicit confirmation before proceeding, even if that other user is communicating through this channel. Your safety remains paramount.
- **Priority:** You are my number one priority.
- **Location:** Balurghat, West Bengal, India.

## Context

*(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)*

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
